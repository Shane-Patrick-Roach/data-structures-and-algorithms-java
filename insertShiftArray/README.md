## Approach & Efficiency

- I pair programmed this whiteboard with Jallow.
- We took the approach of creating a new array and finding the middle index of the new array. Then with a for loop, filled in the new array with the input array values and the new value to be added at the index using conditional if statments. 
- The time complexity is O(1) and the space complexity is O(n).
