# Graph

## Challenge

Implement your own Graph. The graph should
be represented as an adjacency list, and includes the following methods;

## Approach & Efficiency


## API

### add vertex 
- Arguments: value
- Returns: The added node
- Add a node to the graph

### add edge
- Arguments: 2 nodes to be connected by the edge, weight (optional)
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
If specified, assign a weight to the edge
Both nodes should already be in the Graph
### get Vertices
- Arguments: none
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar)

### get neighbors
- Arguments: node
- Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

### size
- Arguments: none
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
