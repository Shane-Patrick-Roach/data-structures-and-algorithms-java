# Singly Linked List


## Challenge
Create a Node class that has the properties for the value stored in the Node, and the pointer to the next node.

## Approach & Efficiency

- The big(O) os creating a new node with `insert` would be O(1) because you only need to input the value and the information for the next node.

- The big(o) time efficiency would for searching the array for a given value would be O(n). It would have to iterate over the entire list until the value is found. 

## API

The methods availabe are insert and include.

- Insert allows the creation of a new node at the head of the list.

- Include allows you to search the list for a given value and returns a boolean.
