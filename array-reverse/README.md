# Reverse an Array

Write a funtion that takes in an array and returns an array with the elements reversed.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Whiteboarding is a new thing for me so I am not quite sure the best way to approach this is yet.

- I beleive that the big O space complexity is O(n) and time complexity is O(n) as well. The space complexity is dependent on the size of the array only and only one iteration is performed. The time is dependent on how big the array is aswell?

- How do you test otherwise measure efficiency?
