# Binary Search

## Binary Search Array

Write a funtion that takes in two parameters, a sorted array and the search key. Without using any built in methods. Return the index of the arrays element that is equal to the value of the search key or -1 if it is not present.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Very exciting to get to work with the binary search. I had never seen or hear about the algorithm so it was cool to research. 
- The best case senario O(1). The worst case is O(log(n)). 
- After researching there seems like two approaches to take. One with iteratuve approach, and the other with recursive approach. I took the iterave approach.
